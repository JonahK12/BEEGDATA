* Program Purpose: Create tables / views from a dataset on purchases from the MegaMarket online marketplace for a period of 4 months. Said tables can be used to make visualizations
  and other analyses on the Megamarket website.
* Compile / run
- Download megamarket.parquet file from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexxl/megamarket
- Copy from megamarket_code.txt to an environment that supports Linux, HDFS and Hive. Linux code is marked as "--shell" and HiveQL is marked as "beeline". 
Replace filepaths with ones that fit your device as needed (i.e. /user/bd0356... will need to be replaced).
